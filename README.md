# USGS-Earthquake-Analysis-with-leaflet

## Purpose
This is an assignment that I completed for the George Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp, focused on visualizing with Leaflet.

##Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

##Prompt
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

##Process
I used Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on longitude and latitude. 
My data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
In addition to this, I included popups that provide additional information about specific earthquakes when the associated marker is clicked. And I added a legend to provide context to the map data.
